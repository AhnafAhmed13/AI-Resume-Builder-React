Using **React Hook Form**, user inputs such as resume files, GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio links are collected and sent to the back end. Once received, Flask processes and analyzes these inputs utilizing the **Milvus vector database** and **OpenAI APIs**, supplemented by web scraping to retrieve additional relevant information about specific job postings. This robust data processing enables personalized, data-driven recommendations for each user. Furthermore, Flask manages file uploads and dynamically generates **customized PDF resumes** and **cover letters**, providing users with a seamless, end-to-end career optimization tool.
